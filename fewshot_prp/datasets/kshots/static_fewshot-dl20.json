The force of the wind makes the wind turbine blades spin, and the energy of this motion is converted into electricity by a generator. See a brief wind turbine animation on DOE's Energy Basics Web site. Wind energy is a free, renewable resource. Its use does not affect its future supply. How Can We Use Energy from the Wind? Wind turbines can convert the energy in the wind into mechanical power that can be used for a variety of activities like pumping water. Wind turbines can also use generators to convert wind energy into electricity."
