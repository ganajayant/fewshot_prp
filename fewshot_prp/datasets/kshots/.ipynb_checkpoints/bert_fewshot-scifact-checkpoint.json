The term contraction often means to shorten; however, during a muscle contraction the tension may cause muscles to stay the same, get longer or become shorter.The physical process of the contraction happens quickly and in only a few steps.he two proteins that are responsible for muscle contractions are actin and myosin. When myosin and actin interact, it results in a change in the shape of the muscle cells. Contractions happen when actin filaments actually slide over myosin filaments."

The term contraction often means to shorten; however, during a muscle contraction the tension may cause muscles to stay the same, get longer or become shorter.The physical process of the contraction happens quickly and in only a few steps.he two proteins that are responsible for muscle contractions are actin and myosin. When myosin and actin interact, it results in a change in the shape of the muscle cells. Contractions happen when actin filaments actually slide over myosin filaments."

The frequency of a heterozygous C677T mutation is common, occurring in about 35% of the population.The homozygous C677T mutation is about 5-10% of the population. A mutation in A1298T is more common but is generally less problematic. The homozygous variety of A1298T occurs in 9% of the population.Another mutation involves both the C677T and the A1298T alleles.he two common MTHFR gene mutations occur at specific locations called âpositionsâ along the gene. The one we generally test for is located at position 677. At this location, one amino acid base pair is different, in that Cytosine is replaced by Thymine. This mutation is thus called C677T."
