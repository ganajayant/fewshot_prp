Tolerance occurs when the person no longer responds to the drug in the way that person initially responded.

For example, in the case of heroin or morphine, tolerance develops rapidly to the analgesic effects of the drug. [The development of tolerance is not addiction, although many drugs that produce tolerance also have addictive potential.] Tolerance to drugs can be produced by several different mechanisms, but in the case of morphine or heroin, tolerance develops at the level of the cellular targets."
