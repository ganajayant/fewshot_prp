Winds are created by the sun's uneven heating of the atmosphere in combination with the irregular surface of the earth and the earth's rotation. These winds can be harvested using wind turbines and used to make electricity. The force of the wind makes the wind turbine blades spin, and the energy of this motion is converted into electricity by a generator. See a brief wind turbine animation on DOE's Energy Basics Web site. Wind energy is a free, renewable resource. Its use does not affect its future supply. How Can We Use Energy from the Wind? Wind turbines can convert the energy in the wind into mechanical power that can be used for a variety of activities like pumping water.

Study of an animal's chromosomes using blood samples can identify several genetic defects. Below are some of the most common genetic defects in sheep. Jaw defects Jaw defects are present in almost all breeds of sheep and are associated with failure of the incisor teeth to properly meet the dental pad. A jaw is undershot if the incisor teeth extend forward past the dental pad; it is overshot if the teeth hit in back of the dental pad (this condition is known as parrot mouth). Cull sheep with either of these genetic defects. If the sire and dam can be identified, remove them from the flock. Overbite: (overshot, parrot mouth, class, overjet, mandibular branchygnathism) In this condition the upper jaw is longer than the lower jaw. There is a gap between the upper and lower incisors when the mouth is closed."
